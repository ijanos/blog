This year's [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) starts in a few hours. I
had a really good time participating in it last year. Having a programming
puzzle to solve every day as count down to the holidays was surprisingly fun. I
had a self imposed challenge of doing at least one commit every day which I then
continued to pretty long commit streak right before GitHub
[removed](https://github.com/blog/2173-more-contributions-on-your-profile) the
counter.


Last year I was using python to solve the puzzles, you can check out [my
solutions](https://github.com/ijanos/advent2015) on GitHub. This year I think I
am going with my new love, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).

My only complaint about Advent of Code is that the leaderboards are based on the
time you submit your answer, but since the puzzles go live early in the timezone
I live in I sleep while the leaderboard gets filled.

In addition to the programming puzzles, I also recommend the vibrant
[subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) it had a great community
last year.
