Hi there, I'm JÃ¡nos. This is my unique little corner on the internet where I keep
my public thoughts, notes and rants about various topics, mostly software, open
source, some pop culture and maybe boardgames. I write for my own entertainment
and in the hope that writing will help me practising my written English skills.
I'll be really happy if you have any feedback about the blog, feel free to
contact me through email: [hello@janosilles.com](mailto:hello@janosilles.com)
